# Predicting-Free-Trial-Conversion-for-Enhanced-Customer-Acquisition-and-Revenue-Growth

**Project Title:** Predicting Free Trial Conversion for Enhanced Customer Acquisition and Revenue Growth

---

**Project Overview**
This project develops a robust machine learning model designed to predict the likelihood of a free trial user converting into a paying customer. By leveraging various user demographics, engagement metrics, and campaign data, this system provides actionable insights to optimize customer acquisition strategies and drive revenue growth for businesses offering trial periods.

**Importance of Solving This Problem**

1. **Optimized Marketing and Sales Efforts**: Focus resources on high-potential users to improve acquisition campaign ROI.
2. **Enhanced Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Efficiency**: Attract and convert genuinely interested users, lowering CAC.
3. **Improved Conversion Rates**: Use predictive interventions for users at various risk levels.
4. **Maximized Revenue Growth**: More conversions lead to more paying users and revenue.
5. **Product and Feature Optimization**: Learn from behavior patterns of converted vs. non-converted users.
6. **Customer Lifecycle Management**: Strategize based on user segmentation during the trial journey.
7. **Competitive Advantage**: Improve acquisition and retention via predictive insights.

**Features**

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**:

   * Loads `free_trial_data.csv`
   * Initial inspection of shape, data types, and descriptive statistics

2. **Comprehensive Data Preprocessing**:

   * Numerical Features: Age, Income, AdSpend, WebsiteVisits, etc.
   * Categorical Features: Gender, CampaignChannel, AdvertisingPlatform
   * Uses `StandardScaler` and `OneHotEncoder`
   * Handles missing values for data integrity

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

   * Visualizations (histograms, box plots, heatmaps, etc.)
   * Identifies conversion drivers

4. **Machine Learning Model Training**:

   * Models: `LogisticRegression`, `RandomForestClassifier`, `GradientBoostingClassifier`, and optionally `XGBoost`
   * Pipelines used to encapsulate preprocessing + modeling

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:

   * `GridSearchCV` to find optimal model parameters

6. **Model Evaluation**:

   * `classification_report`, `confusion_matrix`, `roc_auc_score`
   * Selects the best model based on performance metrics

7. **Model Persistence**:

   * Saves best model and pipeline using `pickle`

8. **Conversion Prediction Function**:

   * `predict_conversion()` accepts new user input and returns prediction and probability

**Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites**:

   * Python 3.7+
   * Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

2. **Installation**:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
   ```

3. **Setup**:

   * Download the notebook: `Predicting Free Trial Conversion for Enhanced Customer Acquisition and Revenue Growth.ipynb`
   * Download `free_trial_data.csv` in the same folder

4. **Usage**:
